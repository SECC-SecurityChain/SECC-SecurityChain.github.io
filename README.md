## Introduction to Security Chain

The World's First Blockchain Security Ecological Chain. Secure Chain is addressing and solving all problems caused by unbalanced security ecosystem to provide a fully decentralized, democratic and secure blockchain-powered internet infrastructure.

It builds security ecological circle consisting of security elites, top hackers and white hat through Blockchain technology and certification and becomes an indispensable support for major exchanges, wallets, and Blockchain projects.

### Security Architecture of Nodes

Nodes are the key building blocks of the Security Chain infrastructure and they host both the security components and the developers’ applications. There are large business and security advantage of removing custom security solutions from the application layer and use instead proven security solutions from the infrastructure layer.

### Community Support and Services

Security Chain is committed to an open ecosystem and its ability to offer alternatives for security components by building a functional incentive system to create sufficient concentration of community experts for each available security component. It can turn around the asymmetric security benefits towards the the white-hat hackers and the community of expert contributors as well as progressive startup innovators.

### Business Potential and Milestone

Predictability of capital budgeting and business environment to support long term investments and customer adoption;
Easy deployment with pre-hardened, flexible configuration; Savings on new or existing security solutions; 
Ease of development; 
Reinforced freemium model for security components in an open-source world; 
Security Chain economy’s ability to generate amortization & contribution margin
